Creating using vite 
command : npx create vite my-app-ts --template react-ts
here hitting npx and creating vite application named "my-app-ts" with typescript
what I got : 
public folder with an image
src folder with assests subfolder having more images
an App.css , App.tsx ,index.css , main.tsx 
an .gitignore
and index.html is outside the src with configs
We get 
-tsconfig 
-package.json 

its lightwieght and fast because : 
node modules are not installed while initiating the project ; they do afterwars , as we can insatll things that we want 
Not like create-react-app where we have this script and web vitals utilitites also pre installed 
no unneccery packages are aleready installed  . Only neccesry packages are installed
npm run dev will heat the application on 
Hot module replacement  (Esbuild)
-direactly supports typescript



Createing using create react app 
npx create-react-app mu-app-ts --template typescript 
what I got : 
node modules 
public  : images 
src : App.tsx 
	index.tsx(main.tsx in vite)
takes more time to load 

slow as it uses Webpack and procsses the entire app before serving  changes 
it has hidden webpack config - eject (makes it more slow )
- uses babel to support typescript



Es-Module based hot module replacement 
-allows a react app to update only the changed modules in the browser withour reloading the entire page 
Webpack HMR reprocesses and rebundles files, which slows down large projects.
Vite HMR only reloads the affected modules using native ES Modules, making it super fast.
